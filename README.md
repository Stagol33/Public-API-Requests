# Random User Directory
# Project Description
# This project creates a directory of random users fetched from the Random User Generator API. It displays 12 random employees with their basic information and allows users to click on an employee to see more detailed information in a modal window.
# Features

# Fetches 12 random users from the API
# Displays user cards with image, name, email, and location
# Shows detailed information in a modal when a card is clicked
# Search functionality to filter users by name
# Modal navigation with previous and next buttons
# Custom styling for a more modern and interactive interface

# Custom Styling Changes
# I've made the following styling modifications to enhance the user experience:

# Color Scheme

# Changed the background color to a soft light blue (#f9f7f7) for better readability
# Implemented a complementary color for buttons (#3f72af) with darker hover state (#112d4e)


# Card Enhancements

# Added subtle box shadows (0 4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)) for a 3D effect
# Implemented hover animations that lift the card slightly (translateY(-5px))
# Increased shadow depth on hover for better visual feedback
# Added rounded corners (8px border-radius) for a more modern look


# Search Input Refinements

# Used a pill-shaped design with rounded corners (20px border-radius)
# Added padding and a light shadow for depth


# Modal Improvements

# Increased border radius (10px) for a softer appearance
# Enhanced the shadow effect (0 8px 16px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2)) for better separation from background
# Made the close button circular with a hover effect
# Added smooth transitions for all interactive elements


# Button Styling

# Updated all buttons with a consistent color scheme
# Added transition effects for smoother hover states
# Implemented rounded corners (4px border-radius) for a contemporary look



# These styling changes were implemented to create a more engaging and visually appealing user interface while maintaining the core functionality and layout of the application. The enhanced visual hierarchy helps users navigate the directory more intuitively.
